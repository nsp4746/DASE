Security Posture & Potential Vulnerabilities
• Incident response plan exists but is out of date and untested; many employees untrained.
• No dedicated security team; CTO acts as CISO in name only.
• MFA enforced on GitHub and Office 365 but not consistently on Jenkins or AWS console for legacy admin accounts.
• Basic CloudTrail and CloudWatch logging enabled, but no centralized SIEM and logs are rarely reviewed.
• Dependabot used for OSS vulnerabilities but patching is delayed; no formal vulnerability scanning of production.
• AWS environment has limited segmentation between dev and prod.
• High implicit trust culture makes social engineering likely.
Adversary-Training Brief
High-value objectives: Exfiltrate PHI/PII, obtain source code or API keys, and manipulate patient documents or billing data.
Likely initial access: Phishing against staff, credential theft from legacy admin accounts, or exploitation of misconfigured S3/AWS permissions.
Lateral movement & persistence: Compromise Jenkins or GitHub to alter CI/CD, or retrieve long-lived credentials to access RDS/S3.
Detection opportunities: Unusual S3 access patterns, unexpected CI pipeline changes, or anomalous RDS queries.

2. AeroPay Financial Services LLC (Fintech)
Company Overview
• Name: AeroPay Financial Services LLC
• Industry: Financial technology (online payments & merchant services)
• Location: Charlotte, NC
• Employee Count: 85
• Mission: “Secure, low-fee payments and fast settlements for SMBs while enabling easy developer integration.”
• Core Products: Payments API, recurring billing, merchant dashboard.
• Regulatory Notes: PCI DSS scoped (SAQ A-EP), FinCEN registration for money services.
• NIST Cybersecurity Tier: Tier 3 (Repeatable) — documented practices, not fully standardized across teams.
Key Personnel
• Markus Lee, CEO — ex-payments founder focused on growth.
• Priya Kapoor, CTO — product-focused, understaffed on security.
• Rafael Ortega, Head of Risk & Fraud — owns fraud models.
• Dana Myers, SRE Lead — manages infra and on-call.
• Jamal Wright, IT & Compliance — small team handling PCI evidence.
Key Digital Assets
• Payment Processing API (public endpoints) — revenue stream.
• Transaction Ledger DB (Postgres) — transaction and settlement records.
• Fraud Model & Training Data (S3) — labeled fraud cases and models.
• Merchant Dashboard & Source Repo (GitHub Enterprise).
• Secrets Vault (HashiCorp Vault-lite) — partially rolled out.
• Third-party Integrations: KYC provider, payment gateways, analytics.
Technology Stack
• Cloud: AWS (EKS, RDS, S3)
• Compute: Kubernetes (EKS) + Lambdas
• Backend: Go (payments engine), Python (fraud), Node.js (API gateway)
• Frontend: React + Next.js
• Auth: OAuth2 for API clients; Okta SSO (some admin accounts not onboarded)
• CI/CD: GitHub Actions -> Helm to EKS
• Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch; no centralized SIEM
• Data Pipelines: Kafka for transaction events.
Security Posture & Potential Vulnerabilities
• Okta used but several service/admin accounts bypass SSO; MFA inconsistently applied.
• Some legacy services contain embedded secrets in Kubernetes/Helm instead of Vault.
• Payment API complex webhook flows — potential input validation, idempotency, and rate-limiting issues.
• Heavy reliance on third-party KYC/payment gateways — weak webhook verification could allow supply-chain compromise.
• Centralized S3 with fraud model data accessible to few engineers — data leakage risk.
• CI allows direct merges for some teams; insufficient pre-prod testing for edge cases.
• IR playbooks exist but are not updated for payment-fraud scenarios.
• Sales/support staff may issue temporary API keys or disable fraud flags to assist merchants (social engineering risk).
Adversary-Training Brief
High-value objectives: Exfiltrate transaction ledger, create fraudulent payouts, obtain merchant API keys, or poison the fraud model.
Likely initial access: Credential stuffing on Okta, phishing support staff, abuse of partner webhook.
Privilege escalation & persistence: Compromise GitHub to change CI/CD, retrieve Vault tokens from developer laptops.
Lateral movement: Use compromised service account to access Kafka or lambdas that process payouts.
Detection opportunities: Unusual API traffic patterns, anomalous CI changes, or unexpected S3 access.
